                            <h3>Loan</h3>
                            <p>
                            Financially, a loan is a sum of money lend to an organisation or a group of individuals or an individual by a financial institution ( such as cooperatives, banks), or any other organisation/ individual(s) at an interest rate.
<br><br>It generally involves legal documents specifying the principal amount, time span for which loan is issued, rate of interest, mortgage ( in some cases ) and some other details of relevance.
<br><br>Broadly categorising, Loans can be secured or unsecured.
<br><br><b>Secured loans :</b> In these loans, generally some asset (collateral) is presented by the borrower as a guarantee to repay the loan in time. If unable to do so, the organisation / institution is entitled to carry out necessary actions and if required, even confiscate the collateral.

<br><br><b>Unsecured loans :</b> For getting these loans, a borrower need not put forward any assets as a guarantee for repaying the loan, however, the institutions lending such loans generally charge a higher rate of interest in comparison with secured loans.
