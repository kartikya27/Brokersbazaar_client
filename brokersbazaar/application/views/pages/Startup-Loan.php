                            <p>
                           This is the age of startups. We have seen great entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, Steve jobs, Vijay shekhar Sharma (Paytm), Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal (Flipkart) and many others leaving a mark with their ideas.

<br><br>However, all these great entrepreneurs started with an idea, which always requires capital in hand to turn an idea into reality. Startup Loans help realising such business ideas and help them grow. Startup loans
<br><br>A startup loan is a personal loan available to an individual who seeks to start or grow a business.
<br><br>One of the greatest advantages of a startup loan is that one need not show any assets for getting the loan, i.e., one gets a collateral - free loan.
<br><br>One most important factor while applying for the startup loan is that the person applying for the loan must be able to convince the financer that his business will be able to generate sufficient revenues to ensure timely payment of loans. It doesn't matter if the business succeeds or drowns, one has to repay the loan.
<br><br>However, it must not be confused with a grant and must be paid back in full along with decided rate of interest within the time limit opted for by the person.
<br><br>Also, one cannot spend the money as he wishes to, there are certain norms to be followed, such as one cannot use it for an existing debt payment, or invest it somewhere else (any other venture which is not a part of your existing startup),etc
