                            <h3>What are SMEs?</h3>
                            <p>
                            SME stands for small and medium enterprises. Their definition varies from country to country based upon some factors such as number of employees, annual turnover etc.
<br><br>In the last five decades, these medium and small enterprises have contributed significantly for Indian economy by providing employment opportunities in large numbers, increasing domestic production and thus the exports ,and devising indigenous tools and techniques for promoting industrialisation.

<br><br><b>SME Finance :-</b>
<br><br>Budding small and medium enterprises need finance to expand and accelerate their production operations, however they might not have the security for accessing traditional collateral based loans, plus their turnover might not be high enough to attract investors.
<br><br>SME Finance is funding of such small and medium enterprises to help them grow in their operations. Several private finance companies and banks provide SME loans.
<br><br>In India, Small and Medium enterprises Development Chamber has been working since 23 years for providing a boost to these businesses, by providing them a platform to them for connectivity, interaction with investors and finance companies, importers, exporters etc.
